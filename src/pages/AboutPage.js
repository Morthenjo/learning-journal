              I find it very fun to work with code, I find it to be a chore to
              actually input the content of the page, but the layout, making it
              dynamically and the functions I add to it. I'm still learning to
              not spend too much time on that.

              I've also found out that helping other people with their problems
              is a good way to assess what I've learned myself or just helps me
              learn it better.

            <AboutP>
              I had dabbled in coding when I was younger, playing around with
              flash, actionscript and animation. But after I needed a career
              change, I found a local course called KodeHode where I could learn
              more of the basics and build my coding back up.
            </AboutP>
            <AboutP>
              With the addition of both KodeHode and Scrimba, I'm speedrunning
              my way to working in the programming industry.
